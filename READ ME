Procedure for execution

Software required: Eclipse or Netbeans
Step 1: Github repository: https://github.com/dineshr93/nodesimulation.git
		Github repository already contains the ready made code fed into it. One c
Step 2:	 Two programs [FTCloud & ROCloud] are added in the following directory
	[nodesimulation / src / cloudoutput / extensions / vmallocationpolicies]  
Step 2: Then they are mentioned in the particular java file
         	[nodesimulation / src / cloudoutput / enums / AllocationPolicy.java] 
Step 3: Run the program
Step 4: Simulator will be started.
